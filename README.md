# Aggregating Quantities by Establishment and Item code

# Overview
This project automates the creation of detailed weekly sales reports across multiple establishments. The Python script aggregates, normalizes, and exports results into structured Excel sheetsâ€”one for each shop, and summary sheets for quick analysis.

# Objectives
- Normalize inconsistent shop codes for data integrity.
- Aggregate total sales and quantities by shop and item code.
- Create separate Excel sheets for each shop for easy comparison.

# Tools and Technologies
- **Python** (Pandas, OpenPyXL, Pathlib)
- **Excel**
- **Power BI** (for performance dashboards)

# How to Run
1. Adjust the `base` and `input_file` paths in the script.
2. Run the script in your terminal or visual studio environment.

# Insights
The generated reports enable managers to compare shop performance, track product-level sales, and make data-informed purchasing and marketing decisions.
